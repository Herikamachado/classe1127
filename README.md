Hello! 😄 My name is Bruna, and I hold a master's degree in Biological Sciences (Biophysics) and a degree in Nanotechnology from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). I also worked as a Pre-Doctoral Intern at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Berlin, where I studied gaze behavior. Currently, I am a DevOps student at Ada Tech, and I am learning Linux, Git, Pipelines, Containers, and Cloud (AWS).
